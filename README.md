# Tests for Conda's Version Resolution Algorithm

The repository provides mock-up versions of popular conda packages for quick
testing of version resolution. Run `build.bat` to create a number of package
variants (the script is easily adaptable to Linux) and then experiment with
`conda create` and `conda install` to check if conda picks the expected 
variants.
